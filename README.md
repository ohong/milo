# Milo Facebook Bot

This is a chatbot that helps people drink safely throughout the night. Using automated messages, it helps users in three ways:
  - Suggests healthy habits before going outâ€“hydrating, eating a meal, etc.
  - Advises them throughout the night to pace themselves and stay safe
  - Alerts a friend in case of an emergency

The bot is built with Node.js.
